        <div class="footer-sub">Dothraki is a fictional language created for the television series Game of Thrones, which is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R.R. Martin. The language was developed by linguist David J. Peterson, who was hired by the show's producers to create a fully-realized, believable language for the Dothraki people, a nomadic horse-riding culture in the show.
